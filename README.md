# my-financial-fortress-frontend
Frontend of an application for securing the financial future. It is based on knowledge from Marcin IwuÄ‡'s book "Financial Fortress", where the author presented a model portfolio to ensure a secure future for long-term investments such as retirement. The application suggests how to allocate capital to individual financial instruments along with their valuation history. The frontend shows the percentage as well as financial distribution of our portfolio along with deviations from the model portfolio. It makes it easy to check the valuation history of the entire portfolio, as well as its individual components.
